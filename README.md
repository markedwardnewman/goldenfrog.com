# Golden Frog
### A challenge...

Replicate the static content and design of the responsive web page design for the two breakpoints provided in `designs/GF_frontend_candidate_wide.png` and `designs/GF_frontend_candidate_narrow.png`. Assets are provided in the `assets` folder. Colors and font styles are provided in `designs/styles.png`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Provide at least one .html file.
- Provide at least one stylesheet file.
- Do not use any UI frameworks or libraries to assist with styling.
### Results
Two weeks later, after nary a peep, I Inquired about the status of my submission.  As luck would have it, I was told that they never received it and that the position had already been filled. =( Oh well.

I did end up creating my own responsive mini-framework using just flexbox though, which is pretty kickass.
